**CDP (Customer Data Platform)** data engineering refers to the process of building, managing, and optimizing the data infrastructure and pipelines that support a Customer Data Platform. A CDP is a system that collects, integrates, and organizes customer data from various sources into a unified customer profile, making it accessible for marketing, sales, and other business functions. CDP data engineering focuses on the technical aspects of handling this data, ensuring it is properly collected, cleaned, transformed, and stored.
