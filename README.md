**CDP (Customer Data Platform)** data engineering refers to the process of building, managing, and optimizing the data infrastructure and pipelines that support a Customer Data Platform. A CDP is a system that collects, integrates, and organizes customer data from various sources into a unified customer profile, making it accessible for marketing, sales, and other business functions.
