## What Is CDP and How Does it work?
- A **customer data platform (CDP)** is designed for marketing. It collects and unifies first-party customer data from multiple sources to build a single, coherent, complete view of each customer. It then makes that data available to marketers to create targeted and personalized marketing campaigns.


The best way to explain this is by example. Say a company is trying to get a better understanding of their customers. Their CDP would be used to collect data from touch points like Facebook, the company's website, email, and any other place a customer might interact with the company

### CDP vs CRM:
A CRM works well as an operational tool for managing sales performance and pipelines. It also tracks purchase history and forecasts revenue. A CDP, on the other hand, serves as an analytical engine for multiple consumer-facing teams through its centralization of data from internal and external sources.
