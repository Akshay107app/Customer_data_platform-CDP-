## What Is CDP and How Does it work?
- A **customer data platform (CDP)** is designed for marketing. It collects and unifies first-party customer data from multiple sources to build a single, coherent, complete view of each customer. It then makes that data available to marketers to create targeted and personalized marketing campaigns.
